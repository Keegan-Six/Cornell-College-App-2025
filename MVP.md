Basic framework has been completed. Main screen with links to all other planned screens has been implemented, although not all planned screens have been implemented. Weather functionality has been added with basic info about current weather added to the main screen, with an option to display the 7-day forecast in another screen. Both features are fully implemented. The dining menu screen has been implemented, using WEBVIEW, a built-in tool in android studio, it displays the webpage where dining information for the hilltop café is stored. It also uses JavaScript to move to the section of the webpage where the dining room information is displayed. It does this automatically. There are quick links at the bottom of the mains screen that link to Moodle, Self-Service, and the library website. These open the pages in a web browser. I showed off the Options menu, which I was working on at the time, which featured buttons that were going to allow the user to change the color scheme of the app.
