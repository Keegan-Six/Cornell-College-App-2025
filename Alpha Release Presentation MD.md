Purpose and Goals

-   Create a project that allowed me to demonstrate a wide variety of
    techniques and skills learned throughout my time in college.

-   Demonstrate programming skills, database management skills, and
    project management skills.

-   Create something prospective employers could see that showcases my
    skills.

Measurement of What Has Been Done

-   1300+ lines of code

-   20 functions

-   1 interface, 3 objects, 9 classes

-   5 files

Organization

-   Main activity.kt ( launches application)

-   Functions.kt (holds functions)

-   Screens.kt (screen UI information and construction)

-   ObjectsClassesInterfaces.kt (self-explanatory)

-   Firebase.kt (sets up access to firebase and used to write to
    firebase sample data)

Problems and Issues

-   Originally was going to use SQL-Lite, after many hours, was unable
    to successfully implement. Android Studio was unable to build the
    database. Chose to use Firebase instead.

-   Remembering a value throughout the entire apps lifetime was
    difficult to implement, eventually decided to pass the needed global
    value throughout all screens.

-   Learning Kotlin and Android Studio to create app took considerable
    time, about 10 hours for initial/basic setup, and more for learning
    how to implement Google Maps, Webpages, Database functionality,
    Weather API and JSON/HTTP requests.
