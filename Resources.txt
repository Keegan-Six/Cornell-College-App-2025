Android Studio is the official IDE for Google’s Android operating system, designed exclusivly for Android development. I used this because I wanted to create an app, and it is one of the easiest and most accessible apps to use, as it is free and has many official tutorials from Google.

Excellent tutorials on a wide variety of topics regarding coding in Android Studio.

Kotlin is a programming language developed by JetBrains, which is an object-oriented programming language similar to Java. It fully extends all existing Java libraries so all of its functions can be used. Kotlin is recommended by Google to be used in Android development, and as I am already familiar with object-orientred programing, I chose to use their app.

SQL-Lite is a C programming language library that implements a self-contained structure query language database engine. It is the most used database in the world. I’m using it because it is built into all mobile phones and has direct support with Android Studio. I can directly use SQL-lite through Android studio, without having to download any other software.

GitHub is well known online platform that allows developers to share and manage code.

WeatherAPI is an API that provides weather information for free, will be used to show weather information.
