**What went well?**

-   Development went much quicker than anticipated

-   All features were able to be implemented

-   Final product appears to be bug-free

-   Able to implement optional features I planned if all main features
    were able to be met

**What went bad?**

-   Unable to use SQL-Lite with project, had to use Firebase.

-   WeatherAPI downgraded features mid-development, had to spend lots of
    time debugging.

-   Issues with elements not appearing on screen when created.

**What do I wish I could improve?**

-   Layout, the layout works, but I wish I had the skills to make it
    more visually appealing.

-   More error checking, I do error checking for functions that can
    cause crashing, but more feedback could be provided to the user for
    errors that don't crash the app.

-   Utilize SQL-Lite instead of Firebase

-   Utilize more learned programming concepts, most programming I did
    was creating UI, I used relatively few concepts learned from classes
    at Cornell and Iowa State.

**What was Learned?**

-   App development process for Android Studio

-   Kotlin programming language

-   Lambda functions

-   Large scale project development

-   Github repository management

-   HTTP and JSON requests/parsing

-   Using APIs

**Questions**

-   How could I improve the layout? Any suggestions?

-   Any other features that could be added that would be beneficial for
    Cornell College students?

-   What other options for user app configuration would be helpful?
